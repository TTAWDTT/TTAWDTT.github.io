# Getting Started
This page is a sample article. Replace it with your own content.

## File structure
- `index.html` controls the layout.
- `assets/styles.css` controls the visual style.
- `assets/app.js` handles markdown loading.
- `content/aboutme.md` is your About page.
- `docs/*.md` are your docs pages.

## Writing tips
Use clear headings, short paragraphs, and callouts for emphasis.

> Markdown links to other docs can be written like `[Title](docs/your-file.md)`.
