# About Me
I am a builder focused on clean interfaces, clear writing, and thoughtful systems.
This page is where I share my background, values, and the kinds of problems I enjoy.

## Focus Areas
- Product design with a developer mindset
- Calm, readable documentation
- Practical automation that removes friction

## Working Style
I like to turn messy ideas into structured outcomes. If a problem can be simplified,
I will chase the smallest, most elegant solution that still feels bold.
